"""Instructions
Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is."""

def leap_year(year):
    if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0:
        return True
    elif year % 100 == 0 and year % 400 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
